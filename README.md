## 🏛️ The Vision
**Epoch Forge** is a premium tactical companion for *Empire Earth: Art of Conquest*. It replaces the messy guesswork of manual civilization building with a cinematic, logic-driven "War-Room" experience.

Whether you are preparing for a competitive **Tournament**, looking for **Casual** flavor, or embracing the **Chaos** of extreme builds, the Forge generates viable, epoch-compliant civilizations in seconds.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 📡 Tactical Session UI
A multi-stage configuration flow that covers **Operative Selection** (Players), **Roster Logistics** (Map/Mode), **Temporal Alignment** (Epochs), and **Operational Logic** (Weights).

### ⚡ The "Phase Shift" Transition
Experience the transition from configuration to execution. Clicking **Finalize Strategy** triggers a high-impact, cinematic shift into the **Forge Phase**, featuring professional particle effects and sound design.

### 🔊 Atmospheric Soundscape
Integrated audio services bring the session to life:
- **Anvil Clangs** on Forge completion.
- **Fire Crackles** during the calculation process.
- **In-Game Unit Sounds** provide tactile feedback for every interaction.

### 🧬 Deterministic Seed Contract
Every match is driven by a cryptographic seed. The **same seed + same rules = identical builds**, allowing you to share entire sessions with a single URL.

### 🗺️ Context-Aware Intelligence
The generator isn't random—it's smart.
- **Map Type Awareness**: It weights builds for Land, Water, or Space based on your selected theater of war.
- **Archetype Focus**: Assign player archetypes (Aggressive, Defensive, Tech, etc.) to bias the generator output toward specific playstyles.

## 🧠 Strategic Logic (The "Contracts")

### 1. The Generation Freeze
Once a session is "Forged," all setup parameters are locked. Any change to the map, epochs, or player count forces a full recalculation to maintain project integrity.

### 2. Eligibility vs Weighting
The Forge distinguishes between **Hard Rules** (Exclusions) and **Soft Suggestions** (Weights).
- **Hard Rule**: If the match ends in the Bronze Age, Nanotech is *strictly* excluded.
- **Soft Suggestion**: If the Map is "Small Islands," Naval technologies receive a high priority weight.

### 3. Cost Calculation Formula
We use the exact in-game logic for multiple bonus costs:
`final_cost = base_cost + (taken_count_in_heading × multiple_bonus_cost)`
